## ⚙️ What I Do Best

- 🔧 Ship bulletproof APIs and backend systems that don’t break — even on a bad day.  
- 🧠 Think in SOLID, breathe Clean Architecture, and build with CQRS + Onion from day one.  
- ⚙️ Build Redis-backed caching, clean DB schemas, and async flows that just work.  
- 🧩 Turn messy business problems into clean code and measurable outcomes.  
- 💥 Build backend that moves real metrics — churn down, retention up, systems steady.  
- 💻 Quiet confidence. Loud results. And yeah... just enough rizz to make the debugger blush.
